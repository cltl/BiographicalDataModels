# BiographicalDataModels

This repository provides samples of biographical data models. 

At this first stage, we simply show which datamodels are being used and illustrate them through the biographies of fictional characters.

In future stages, we will provide conversions to RDF and mapping mechanisms.

If you want to add your model or have any questions, please contact:
