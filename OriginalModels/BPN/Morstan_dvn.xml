Mary Morstan was the only child of Arthur Morstan, an army officer, and Anna Speck. 
	Her mother died when Mary was still very young. She was educated in London, until her father died while in service in India in 1879. She then started to work as a governess. 
In 1888 she asked for the help of private detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant doctor John Watson. While solving this case,  Morstan and Watson fell in love. They married in 1889.

Mary Morstan is mostly famous for the circumstances surrounding her death in 1891. According to rumours she had married Watson to get close to Sherlock Holmes, because she was part of an intrinsic espionage network. There even were stories about Holmes or Watson being responsible for her death when finding out.

Even though Mary Morstan has been an inspiration for the imagination of many, there never has been any true evidence that she was anything else but a young woman who died at a very young age.
